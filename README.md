Byte by Byte was developed using the following stack:

    Custom Database Solution: The app uses AsyncStorage and a local JSON-based approach for managing user data, with the potential to integrate PouchDB for more robust local storage needs.
    Development Tools:
        - VSCode: The primary IDE for writing and testing the code.
        - Android Studio (AVD): A virtual device was used to simulate the Android environment for testing.
        - Expo: Expo was used to handle the bundling and deployment process for the app, simplifying development and testing across devices.

With these technologies, Byte by Byte provides an efficient, privacy-focused user experience for tracking personal well-being.
